Her research focuses on United States foreign policy in respect to the Cold War and the fight against terrorism. As a Colombian born American citizen, Natalia has seen the effects of US foreign policy in her home country and is interested in seeing how it parallels to events in the Middle East.

- Rafael Rodríguez-Charris '20
--Rafael is a junior Computer Science major and an Economics minor. His research is focused on the cultural activism that indigenous groups in Guatemala have taken to gain recognition at a national level. In order to observe this phenomenon, the research will analyze the politics of language and the initiatives proposed by the indigenous groups in the region, explained by post-colonialist theory of International Relations, which seek to focus the narrative and demands from the standpoint of the oppressed, in this case, the indigenous groups in the region.

- Federico Perelmuter ‘21
--Federico is a Sophomore, and a potential English and/or Comparative Literature and/or Philosophy major/minor. He is interested in Latin American Literature, and particularly fascinated by critical theory and the way rhetorical constructions facilitate the practice of memory in a post-genocidal setting.
