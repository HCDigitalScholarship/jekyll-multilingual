The GAM Digital Archive is a collaborative, post-custodial digitization project that aims to preserve and provide access to materials held by Guatemala’s oldest human rights organization. The GAM's archive contains a unique set of textual, visual, and audio-video materials of significance to ongoing human rights trials, scholars of transitional justice in Latin America, and Guatemala’s historical memory. The [introductory post](http://ds.haverford.edu/gam-archive/2017/12/13/introducing-gam.html) to this blog provides further detail on the project's history.
