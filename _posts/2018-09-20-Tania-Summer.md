#“Me dirijo a usted hoy…” An analysis on the letters of Marina Sandoval, mother of Jorge Sandoval#

If the goal of this project was to tell the stories in the archive, then I wanted to find stories that came directly from the words of  individuals being represented in the archive. One of the first cases I encountered back in January of this year was that of Jorge Mario Alberto Giron Sandoval, an 18 year old boy who was disappeared in May 1985. His case stood out precisely because it was almost entirely made up of different letters his mother, Marina Sandoval de Giron, wrote to various state officials and society members in the hopes of gaining more information regarding the whereabouts of her son. Here was the story of Jorge Sandoval’s disappearance, coming directly from the words of his mother. Exploring more of the archive encouraged me to continue to prioritize this genre of documents for my research; much of the archive that we had seen thus far contained intake forms and legal paperwork, the nature of which does not allow for the same level of nuance and narrative as Marina’s letters. 

Initially, I wanted to focus on the experience of mothers. Research on social movements in Guatemala and other Latin American countries experiencing state violence pointed me to women, specifically mothers, as being at the forefront of these movements. For example, the GAM’s founding members were mothers and wives of disappeared men. For almost six weeks, I only had the case of Jorge Sandoval to work with. Complications with the uploading process of scanned documents onto the public access layer made it so that we had limited access to the archive. During these six weeks, I was nervous that I would not be able to find any other related documents to those I had found in the Sandoval case, but also tried to keep in mind that we were only seeing a very small part of the 3,700 case archive. Soon enough, other cases appeared. 

The five cases had overarching similarities and thematic overlap, but each case contained different amounts of documentation, with some (like Sandoval’s) containing far more than others. Rather than performing surface-level analysis of all five cases, I instead focused on the Sandoval case in order to highlight an individual perspective of a large context of Guatemalan history. The case contains an extensive collection of Marina’s letters to eleven different state officials and society members.

All but two of these institutions or individuals were associated with the Guatemalan government. I decided to approach an analysis on Marina’s letters through a chronological reading of the letters, which allows us to begin to understand how her interpretations of her  relationship to the state changes over time. In the context of these letters, it is necessary to bring in a conversation that looks closely at the relationship individuals had to the Guatemalan state, especially when we consider the role of the state in creating the violence of the mid to late 1900s. What does it mean to appeal to the same state that has created the violence that one is now denouncing? As a student trained in anthropology and with deep interests in political theory, my goal is to explore these questions within the context of one specific case. With such broad questions, I find it important to zoom into how these structures and realities existed on the small scale. Through this analysis, I have been able to establish patterns that allow us to understand the ways in which she would engage with her state to seek justice.

Three days after Jorge disappeared, Marina wrote her first letter; it was addressed to the Chief of State, General Oscar Mejia Victores. This letter is handwritten, and though it is not the only handwritten one, it allows us to read it as something with urgency, especially when we consider that it was sent only 3 days after the disappearance. The other letters I will highlight were all typed and began to follow somewhat of a structure that she seemed to have developed for writing her later letters, especially when they were addressed to higher level officials. The structure of her letters is, more or less,  as follows:

In this letter to the Chief of State General Oscar Mejia Victores, Marina was asking him to order an investigation regarding the whereabouts of her son. It was a straightforward request with brief mention of her son's honorable character.

Her letter to Mejia Victores' wife, Aura Rosal de Mejia Victores, is very different on multiple aspects. Written only 17 days after the disappearance of her son, she has taken a more personal approach in writing this letter, an approach which is paralleled by many of the letters she wrote in the future. Within the first section of her 3-paged letter, she appeals to Aura Rosal on the basis of motherhood.

Comparing her writing in this letter to the writing in her letter to General Mejia Victores, Marina has transitioned into appealing to an individual person rather than appealing to an institution. She provides personal details of her son, explaining that he was the youngest of 7, unemployed and a student. Most other letters solely include his name, age, and political or religious affiliation, depending on the intended audience. In writing to Aura Rosal, Marina appealed to her position as a mother and emphasized the emotional pain of having her son disappeared as well as living in a constant state of uncertainty.

And yet, her request to Aura Rosal was for her to intercede before  General Mejia Victores so that he may “end the uncertainty that is killing [Marina and her family].” Her request to Aura is not significantly different than her request to Mejia Victores. What differentiates the two letters, however, is the emotion that is present in her letter to Aura, which is the basis for her appeals. 

Marina’s letters are one example of a person taking the justice-seeking process into her own hands by personally appealing to different state and society members. She lay bare her emotions and experiences, advocating for justice for her son. Comparing these first two letters also allows us as researchers to begin to identify a pattern. There is a strategic writing of letters that changes depending on who she is writing to.

Roughly 4 months after Jorge's disappearance and writing letters to different institutions and individuals in Guatemala, Marina decided to write to Ronald Reagan, president of the U.S. at the time. When she decided to look to the United States government for support, we start to see vocabulary that we have not seen in her previous letters.

This letter is the first time she uses "democracy," "liberty" and "human rights." In describing Reagan as the "leader of democracy and liberty, the greatest defender of 'human rights'" she is simultaneously condemning the situation of her son as a violation of human rights while declaring that her state is the opposite of all that considers Reagan to be. The treatment she was receiving pushed her to try to bring in international attention and support. Furthermore, she was beginning to insinuate that the disappearance of her son was a human rights violation, which further encouraged her to seek outside of her state— a state to which she had been appealing to for several months and had received little to no responses from.

While she mentions human rights, she does not yet explicitly call the disappearance of Jorge a violation of human rights. In her letter to Reagan, she calls it, instead, a "great sin,” one of many examples of her appeals to Reagan on the basis of a shared faith.

She reassures Reagan of her son's humble, honorable character, but also goes on to explain that the entire family comes from a Christian background. Similar to how she appealed to Aura on the basis of motherhood, she is now appealing to Reagan on the basis of a Christian affiliation. This letter is a combination of aspects of the previous two letters. In writing to Reagan, she is continuing her efforts towards appealing to a state, an institution. But in appealing to him on the basis of Christianity, she is also trying to appeal to a more individual audience.

This final letter in the Sandoval case is addressed to Guatemala's Commission on Human Rights. By addressing it to this commission, she is explicitly defining the disappearance of her son as a violation of human rights, "an injustice."

She is now appealing on the basis of human rights. Unlike previous letters, she thoroughly explains the measures she immediately took following the disappearance, as well as some details regarding calls she has received in regards to her son. By detailing as much of the case as possible, Marina is simultaneously detailing the lengths to which she has gone and the state silence with which she has been met. In the final sections of her letter, Marina couches her appeals on her belief in the existence of clandestine prisons, which further contributes to here appeal on the basis of a human rights violation.

By asking if the earth has swallowed her son, she is establishing the likelihood of Jorge’s whereabouts for the Commission and is attempting to rid any of their doubt. We cannot know how her perceptions of beliefs regarding the whereabouts of her son changed during the timespan of these letters. What these letters do tell us is how she advocated and couched her appeals depending on who she was writing to. With this letter, being one of her final letters in the collection, we can identify her shift in basis of appeals. No longer is she appealing to the individual; this letter was directed to the president or members of the commission. Along with this change in the level to which she appeals to (institutional or personal) is also a change in how she asserts her appeals— no longer is she simply calling it a disappearance, a great source of pain, or an injustice. Now, she is directly calling it a violation of human rights.

My goal was to focus on documents in the GAM archive that feature personal narratives, experiences and emotions of the family members of those who were disappeared. Eight months after my first introduction to Marina’s letters, I am still as moved and impacted by them as the first time. I struggled with how to perform an analysis on this collection without feeling like I was attaching academic jargon or theories onto her personal experiences and emotions. To work through these concerns, I first referred to Frank Afflitto and Paul Jesilow, authors of “Quiet Revolutionaries,” who reminded me that social movements  did not come through radicalism, feminism, or any other -ism. These engagements were born out of necessity. I also turned to Jo Fisher’s “Mothers of the Disappeared,” which was based on the Mothers of Plaza del Mayo in Argentina. Learning about the stories of these women, Fisher struggled to write in such a way that would give justice to their realities. In the end, she saw her role as “one of facilitating an understanding of the context of these events and have tried to leave interpretation and analysis to the women themselves and to avoid intruding into a history which is not my own,” (preface).

Rather than trying to interpret these letters, I have identified patterns across her letters to show how Marina took the justice-seeking process into her own hands. How can I bring these letters into an academic space without diminishing any of their personal and emotional based value? In creating a space for this specific genre of documents that allows us to understand a zoomed in perspective of moments in history, I am arguing for the necessity and value of grounding research in first person documentation efforts, while also reinforcing the validity in recording, writing and remembering history through the lens of individuals.
