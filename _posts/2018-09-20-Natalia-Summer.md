Throughout history, the United States government has often found itself involved in wars outside of its own country, especially those during the Cold War in Latin America. Such was the case during Guatemala’s armed conflict. During this time period, the United States government, the embassy in particular, was guilty in turning a blind eye to many human rights violations included but not limited to murder, disappearances, and massacres. As an anthropology student interested in the effects of policy on human lives, I saw that the GAM archive serves as a portal to understanding the human lives impacted by the Government of Guatemala (GOG) and U.S. government relations.  I began my research by reading several books and articles on US foreign policy in Guatemala, amongst these Armies Without Nations by Robert H. Holden and Dangerous Liaisons: The U. S. in Guatemala by Susanne Jonas, specifically focusing on the early 1980s. My decision to then focus solely on 1982 was largely due to the GAM Archive. While it holds cases from throughout Guatemala ranging from the early to mid 60s all the way to the early 2000s, the large majority of cases come from 1982. I also decided to focus on this time period to see the extent of human rights violations during the reign of President Efrain Rios Montt, as 1982 corresponds with the military junta coup that put Rios Montt in power as well as his “scorched earth” policy, a military strategy to destroyed villages and displace populations.

Using the Digital National Security Archive (DNSA) I found a chronology of United States Government relations with the Government of Guatemala which includes embassy visit reports, presidential meetings, and cables from US officials to and from the United States government as well as GOG developments. I argue that these embassy cables demonstrate the complicity of the United States embassy.  In one of the earliest cables from 1982, before the Rios Montt regime, U.S. embassy political officer Raymond Gonzales writes to the State Department urging the United States government to “avoid condoning … illegal acts [human rights violations] by its silence”. The ambassadors comment to this message implies that doing so would not be beneficial for the United States, even if illegal actions were occurring.

In later U.S. embassy cables from 1982, there are statements that relieve the military of human rights violations and pin the blame on the guerillas, which the embassy states are highly active in the area. They support their claims stating GOG reports; however, no investigation occurs until later in the year from September to November when embassy officials finally visit the areas affected. 

Throughout 1982, Chimaltenango suffered several massacres, disappearances and murders. To understand the extent of the events it is important to understand that the GAM archive is composed of nearly 3,750 cases. 481 of these cases come from the Chimaltenango department, of which 217 are from 1982.  The disappearances divided by months is depicted by the table below.
